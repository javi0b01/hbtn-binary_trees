# 0x1D. C - Binary trees
Foundations - Low-level programming & Algorithm â€• Data structures and Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
* What is a binary tree
* What is the difference between a binary tree and a Binary Search Tree
* What is the possible gain in terms of time complexity compared to linked lists
* What are the depth, the height, the size of a binary tree
* What are the different traversal methods to go through a binary tree
* What is a complete, a full, a perfect, a balanced binary tree
